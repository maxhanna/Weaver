# 🚀 Weaver — AI‑Powered Multi‑File Code Editing

Weaver is an intelligent, agent‑driven development environment that can **modify your entire project from a single natural‑language prompt**. It understands your codebase, plans multi‑step edits, applies atomic diffs, verifies results, and even handles Git operations — all inside a beautiful, integrated IDE.

## 🧨 Why Developers Love Weaver
- One prompt → entire project updated  
- Atomic, safe, reviewable diffs  
- Full IDE + Git + Kanban + Calendar in one app  
- Local, fast, private  
- Works with any project structure  
- Designed for real‑world development, not toy examples  
- Designed for any model type - big or small. The agent's iterative approach should yield similar results for smaller tasks. The bigger LLMs produce similar results in fewer cycles.



## FAQ

### Where to Start

1. Open the options popup (top right of screen)
2. Click on both 'projects' and 'settings' and configure the application
3. Start by adding a card in the kanban, adding files for context and then pressing start

`llamaUrl` specifies the address of your OpenAI API compatible LLM endpoint. This can be any compatible server such as Ollama, llama.cpp, or other local/remote LLM services. By default, Weaver looks for the server at `http://localhost:8080`. If your server runs on a different port or address, update this setting by opening the settings panel or in `weaverconfig.json` to ensure Weaver can connect to your LLM backend.

### What if the backend application won't close?

If the backend application won't close, try closing the website first. Sometimes the backend process remains active even after closing the browser tab, so explicitly closing the website interface can help terminate the backend application properly.

### Force File Edits
In cases where the edit pipeline isn't being chosen,
Employ 'Fix the' keywords to force the agent to make file edits. 
For example, phrase your request as 'Fix the README.md file to add a new section about forced edits' 
or 'Fix the configuration section to clarify the llamaUrl setting'. 
This mechanism ensures that the standard edit pipeline is automatically selected.

## Configuration

`weaverconfig.json` contains `llamaUrl` (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`). Edit if your llama server is at a different address
